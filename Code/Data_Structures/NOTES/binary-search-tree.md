# Binary Search Tree (BST)

---

## 🧠 Definition
A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a binary tree where each node contains a key such that:
- Left child’s key < parent’s key  
- Right child’s key > parent’s key  

---

## 🧮 Properties
- Recursive structure
- Inorder traversal gives sorted order
- Height-balanced trees improve performance

## ⚙️ Operations
| Operation | Best Case | Average | Worst Case |
|------------|------------|----------|-------------|
| Insert     | O(log n)  | O(log n) | O(n) |
| Search     | O(log n)  | O(log n) | O(n) |
| Delete     | O(log n)  | O(log n) | O(n) |
